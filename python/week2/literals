operator precedence
(3 - 1) ** 2 * 6 + 3
the answer is 27 which i verified using PEMDAS(Parenthasis,Exponents,Multiplication,Divison) :

expression = (3 - 1) ** 2 * 6 + 3

print(f"The expression is: {expression}")




CHALLENGES: EVERYTHING about this lab was confusing. I had to resort to old-school math class memories (Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally), to remember the proper sequence of mathThe comman TYPE() was also very confusing because i was expecting to be a command where it would actually type the word similiar
to print()
but the biggest challenge for me was being able to do the actual math in my head to get the final answer from Python.

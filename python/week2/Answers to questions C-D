QUESTION C : the output seems to be an IP adress 127.0.0.1
QUEDSTION D: Flush=false is actually be default, when you want something to show immediately with no delay in between of what youre doing. For example , if you were to write coming soon.. with the periods after coming soon showing up with a delay, then you would use flush=true to add a delay.
QUESTION E: the print() output triggers this because by default ,  especially on a terminal, it starts a new line, making it look like youcommanded it to flush it immediately.


CHALLENGES:  figuring out the difference in using multiple print outputs and single outputs.
I also had to do some reseearch to find out why and when using the flush command is necessary and when it doesnt matter.It was a little hard getting to understad each command

i coded a small message for my girlfriend as well..



import time
print("HI DULCE!!")
print("YOU LIKE MY 1ST COMPUTER PROGRAM? ITS A MESSAGE TO YOU :)")
time.sleep(2)
print("just know.",end='')
time.sleep(3)
print(".")
print("that")
time.sleep(3)
print("i")
time.sleep(2)
print("LOOOOVE")
time.sleep(6)
print("YOU!!!!!!!")
time.sleep(2)
print(":)")
